// 2. Implement a problem of maximize Profit by trading
// stocks based on given rate per day.
// Statement: Given an array arr[] of N positive integers
// which denotes the cost of selling and buying a stock on
// each of the N days. The task is to find the maximum
// profit that can be earned by buying a stock on or selling
// all previously bought stocks on a particular day.
// Input: arr[] = {2, 3, 5} Output: 5
// Input: arr[] = {8, 5, 1} Output: 0
